# Basic Website Framework

## Structure

- `public/` — static assets (images, favicon, etc.)
- `src/` — main code
  - `index.html` — entry point
  - `styles.css` — main stylesheet
  - `main.js` — main JavaScript file

## Setup

1. Open `src/index.html` in your browser to view the site.
2. Add your assets to the `public/` folder as needed.

## Extending

- Add more HTML, CSS, or JS files in `src/` as your project grows.
- Use the `public/` folder for images and other static files.
